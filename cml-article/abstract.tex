\begin{abstract}
Proposes a textual programming language that enables conceptual modeling
(similarly to UML classes/associations and OCL constraints) and a compiler
that allows code generation (via extensible textual templates) to any target
language or technology.
Together, the language and the compiler make it feasible
to specify (in a single high-level language) the information of ever-changing,
increasingly distributed software systems. From this single source,
the automated code generation keeps the implementations 
(across the different platforms and technologies) consistent with the specification.
Also, as the technology landscape evolves, these textual models allow the recurring
use of the investment made on their specification.
Unlike other approaches, such as MDA and MPS, the built-in tooling support,
along with the textual nature of this programming language and its extensible templates,
facilitates the integration to the workflow of software developers,
which is expected to promote its adoption. 
A cost-benefit analysis model is also provided, which should assist the stakeholders
in measuring the return of their investment in modeling.

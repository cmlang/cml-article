\subsection{The CML Metamodel (Abstract Syntax)}\label{subsec:metamodel}

The focus of this language is to enable the specification of conceptual models, such as those specified by ER [reference] models and UML [reference] class diagrams. In [article], [Author] shows how UML models, augmented by OCL constrains, can be used to specify conceptual models by mapping their metamodel to the ER metamodel. In order to present the CML concepts in the following subsections, a similar approach will be used by mapping the CML metamodel to the UML/OCL metamodels.

Below, you can see an overview of the CML metamodel in a UML class diagram (footnote: now used to model the CML metamodel, as opposed to modeling an instance of a CML source file --- a CML model), where each class represents a CML concept:

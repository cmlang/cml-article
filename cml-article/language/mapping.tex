\subsection{Mapping CML to Other Modeling Notations}\label{subsec:mapping}

Part of the CML metamodel (presented in section \ref{subsec:metamodel}) may be considered a small subset of the UML  \cite{uml} metamodel.
Thus, the structural (static) elements of CML models can be transformed into UML class diagrams. The example CML model in the listing of figure \ref{fig:store} is mapped to the UML model in figure \ref{fig:uml}.

\begin{figure}

\caption{The class diagram representing in UML  \cite{uml} the same CML model listed in figure \ref{fig:store}.}
\label{fig:uml}
\end{figure}

In the UML class diagram of figure \ref{fig:uml}:
\begin{itemize}
\item the CML concepts (\emph{BookStore}, \emph{Book}, \emph{Customer} and \emph{Order}) are mapped to corresponding UML classes;
\item the CML properties that represent unidirectional associations
(\emph{books}, \emph{customers}, and \emph{goldCustomers} of \emph{BookStore})
are mapped to UML associations with corresponding roles
(showing the navigability direction, and matching the property names);
\item the CML bidirectional association \emph{CustomerOrder}
(comprised by two CML properties: \emph{Customer.orders} and \emph{Order.customer})
is mapped to a UML association with bidirectional navigability (no direction arrow).
\end{itemize}

As demonstrated by this example, CML's goal is to allow modeling at the same conceptual level possible with UML.
The CML metamodel is limited when compared to the UML metamodel, but it supports a core set of elements from the UML metamodel (as shown in subsection \ref{subsec:metamodel}), which can be used to validate CML's goals.

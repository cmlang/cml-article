\subsection{The Abstract Syntax Tree}\label{subsec:ast}

The \emph{BookStore} concept
\footnote{For brevity,
only displaying the partial tree of the CML model defined in figure \ref{fig:store} (just for the \emph{BookStore} concept), 
but a similar tree is generated by the compiler for all other concepts.}
specified in the model of figure \ref{fig:store},
when parsed and instantiated by the CML compiler,
generates the following abstract syntax tree:

The model above can also be represented as the following ER model:

The model can also be shown as the following UML class diagram:

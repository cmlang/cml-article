\subsection{An Example}\label{subsec:example}

Before exploring the abstract syntax, a concrete example is displayed in figure \ref{fig:store} and commented below:

\pagebreak

\input{language/bookstore.tex}

As seen on the example of figure \ref{fig:store}, some concepts are declared, such as \emph{Book} and \emph{Customer}. 
The block-based syntax declaring each concept resembles the C \cite{clang} language's syntax. 
Each concept declares a list of properties.
The property declarations are based on the Pascal \cite{pascal} style for variable declarations, where the name is followed by colon (``:'') and then the type declaration.
Some syntax, such as the expression in \emph{BookStore}'s \emph{orderedBooks}, is based on OCL \cite{ocl} expressions; while other syntax, such as the expression in \emph{goldCustomers} is new, even though its semantics also match OCL \cite{ocl} query expressions.

\section{The Language}\label{sec:lang}

This section presents an overview of the conceptual modeling language.
The concrete syntax will be presented using examples.
An appendix is available with a formal description of the concrete syntax.
The abstract syntax will be presented in subsections; each one focusing on a key concept of the language's metamodel.

Before exploring the abstract syntax, a concrete example is displayed and commented below:

\input{language/bookstore.tex}

The model specified by the example above will be parsed and instantiated by the CML compiler into the following abstract syntax tree:

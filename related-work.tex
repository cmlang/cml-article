\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}

The following subsections compare CML to other languages, tools and frameworks
that can also generate code from conceptual models.
Each subsection covers a different category,
enumerating specific solutions and characterizing their relevance to CML, and also their differences. 

\subsection{Textual Languages}

This subsection covers existing text-based languages designed to enable code generation from conceptual models.
It is the most relevant subsection when comparing to CML,
which is also a textual language designed for code generation.

Here they are:

\begin{itemize}
\item MPS
\item M Language
\item Xtext/Xtend
\item MM-DSL
\item XML/XSLT
\item IFML
\end{itemize}

It is important to observe that most of these solutions enable modeling via DSLs, while CML is a generic language used to create models in any domain.

This paper presents a textual programming language for conceptual modeling
(based on UML classes/associations and OCL constraints)
and a compiler that can generate code to any target language or technology
via extensible textual templates.
The language and compiler allow the specification of ever-changing,
increasingly distributed software systems in a single high-level language.
From a single source,
automated code generation keeps implementations consistent with the specification
across the different platforms and technologies.
Furthermore, as the technology landscape evolves,
the target templates may be extended to embrace new technologies.
Unlike other approaches,
such as MDA and MPS,
the built-in tooling support,
along with the textual nature of this modeling language and its extensible templates,
is believed to facilitate the integration of this practice into the workflow of software developers.

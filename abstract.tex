\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a textual programming language for conceptual modeling
(based on UML classes/associations and OCL constraints)
and its compiler that can generate code in any target language or technology
via extensible textual templates,
both currently under initial stage of development.
The language and compiler should allow the specification of information
managed by ever-changing, increasingly distributed software systems.
From a single source,
automated code generation should keep implementations consistent with the specification
across the different platforms and technologies.
Furthermore, as the technology landscape evolves,
the target templates may be extended to embrace new technologies.
Unlike other approaches,
such as MDA and MPS,
the built-in tooling support,
and the textual nature of this modeling language and its extensible templates,
is expected to facilitate the integration of model-driven software development
into the workflow of software developers.

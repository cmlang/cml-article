\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

The CML language and compiler make it feasible to specify
(in a single high-level language)
the concepts and associations of ever-changing,
increasingly distributed software systems.

As opposed to implementing these concepts and associations in each target language,
from a single CML model,
the CML extensible templates generate code that
keeps the implementations 
(across the different platforms and technologies) 
consistent with the specification.
Also, as the technology landscape evolves,
these textual CML models can be reused to generate code in new target languages and technologies.

This first CML version has been designed for the initial validation of the textual model-driven development approach taken here.
As developers provide feedback,
new language features may be iteratively added in order to enable the extensible CML compiler to support new modeling/development scenarios.

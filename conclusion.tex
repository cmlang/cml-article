\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

The CML language and the compiler make it feasible
to specify (in a single high-level language) the information of ever-changing,
increasingly distributed software systems.
From a single source,
the automated code generation keeps the implementations 
(across the different platforms and technologies) consistent with the specification.
Also, as the technology landscape evolves, these textual models allow the recurring
use of the investment made on their specification.
This first CML version has been designed for the initial validation of the model- driven development approach taken by CML.
As developers provide feedback,
new language features may be iteratively added in order to enable the extensible CML compiler to support new modeling/development scenarios.

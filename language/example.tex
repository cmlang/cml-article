\subsection{An Example}\label{subsec:example}

On the example of figure \ref{fig:store}, some concepts, such as \emph{Book} and \emph{Customer}, are declared in CML. 
The block-based syntax declaring each concept resembles the C \cite{clang} language's syntax. 
Each concept declares a list of properties.
The property declarations are based on the Pascal \cite{pascal} style for variable declarations,
where the name is followed by a colon (``:'') and then the type declaration.
Part of the CML syntax for expressions, such as the expression in \emph{BookStore}'s \emph{orderedBooks}, is based on OCL \cite{ocl} expressions; while the syntax of the expression in \emph{goldCustomers} is new, its semantics also match OCL \cite{ocl} query expressions.

Some examples of the key language features shown in the figure \ref{fig:store} are:
\begin{itemize}
\item concepts: \emph{Book} and \emph{Customer};
\item attributes: \emph{title} and \emph{price} under the \emph{Book} concept;  
\item derived attributes: \emph{totalSales} under the \emph{Customer} concept;
\item unidirectional associations: the \emph{books} and \emph{customers} properties as declared under the \emph{BookStore} concept are used to represent unidirectional associations (in UML \cite{uml}, they would correspond to the association roles);
\item bidirectional associations: \emph{CustomerOrder},
which binds two unidirectional associations (represented by the \emph{orders} property under the \emph{Customer} concept and by the \emph{customer} property under the \emph{Order} concept) into a single bidirectional association;
\item derived associations: declared as the \emph{goldCustomers} and \emph{orderedBooks} properties under the \emph{BookStore} concept.
\end{itemize}

These language features will be defined in the subsection \ref{subsec:metamodel}.

\section{The Language}\label{sec:lang}
%
This section presents an overview of the conceptual modeling language.
The \emph{concrete syntax} is presented using an example in subsection \ref{subsec:example}. 
In subsection \ref{subsec:ast},
the example's model is shown as an \emph{abstract syntax tree} parsed by the CML compiler.
The mapping of the CML example to other modeling notations is illustrated in subsection \ref{subsec:mapping}.
The CML metamodel (the \emph{abstract syntax}'s structure) is presented in subsection \ref{subsec:metamodel}. 
(The \emph{CML specification} \cite{cml-spec} provides a formal description of the \emph{concrete syntax},
along with its mapping to the \emph{abstract syntax}.)

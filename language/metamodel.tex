\subsection{The CML Metamodel (Abstract Syntax)}\label{subsec:metamodel}

In the article \emph{UML and OCL in Conceptual Modeling}, 
Gogolla \cite{gogolla} shows, by mapping the UML \cite{uml} metamodel to the ER \cite{er} metamodel,
how UML models (augmented by OCL \cite{ocl} constraints) can be used to specify conceptual models.
Also, Wazlawick \cite{wazlawick} systematically prescribes in his book a method for conceptual modeling using UML and OCL. 

Since one key CML goal is enabling the specification of conceptual models
(such as those specified by ER models and UML/OCL models),
in order to present the key elements of the CML metamodel,
a similar approach to Gogolla's is used to map the CML metamodel to the ER metamodel,
and to the UML/OCL metamodel.

The EMOF \cite{mof} model presented by figure \ref{fig:metamodel} is a simplified version of the CML metamodel:

\end{figure}

In CML metamodel shown in figure \ref{fig:metamodel},
a \emph{Concept} is composed of zero-or-more \emph{Property} instances.
Each \emph{Property} may have a \emph{Type} and an \emph{Expression}.
If two \emph{Property} instances represent the same bidirectional association,
there must be an \emph{Association} instance that binds them.
Unidirectional associations are only represented by the \emph{Property} instance (representing the association role)
that enables the navigation from the source \emph{Concept} instance to the target one (which is represented by the property's \emph{Type}.)

Next, there is a description for the key metamodel elements.

\subsubsection{Concept.}

According to Wazlawick \cite{wazlawick},
a concept represents complex information that has a coherent meaning in the domain.
They aggregate attributes and cannot be described as primitive values.
They may also be associated with other concepts.
On the ER metamodel are known as \emph{entity};
on the UML metamodel, as \emph{class}.

\subsubsection{Property.}

May be an attribute holding values of primitive types,
or references (or collections of references) linking concepts.
On the ER metamodel,
the set of all references is known as \emph{relationship};
on the UML metamodel, unidirectional associations.
Attributes have the same name on all metamodels.

\subsubsection{Association.}

Unlike the ER and UML metamodels, in the CML metamodel, only bidirectional associations are represented with the Association class. They bind the non-primitive properties (from the same or from different concepts.) 


\subsubsection{Type.} They may be primitive types (such as Boolean, String, Decimal, and Regex), references to concept instances, or still collections of concepts. They may also be optional, meaning their value may or may not have been set.

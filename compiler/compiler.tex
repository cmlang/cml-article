\section{The Extensible Compiler}\label{sec:compiler}

In order to realize the CMP \cite{cmp} manifesto's vision,
the CML compiler generates code in any target language based on extensible templates.
A set of core templates is provided by the CML compiler's base libraries.
Third-party libraries can also provide their own templates,
along with their conceptual models,
in order to target specific technologies or platforms.
Developers can also extend existing templates in order to adapt the implementation to characteristics specific to their projects.

Subsection \ref{subsec:overview} will provide an overview of the CML compiler's architecture.
Next, subsection \ref{subsec:templates} will introduce the CML compiler's extensible templates.
Finally, subsection \ref{subsec:modlib} will lay out the CML compiler's mechanism for organizing and sharing conceptual models and extensible templates.

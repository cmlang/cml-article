\section{The Extensible Compiler}\label{sec:compiler}

In order to realize the CMP \cite{cmp} manifesto's vision,
the CML compiler can generate code in any target language,
given that the corresponding templates are provided.
A set of core templates is provided by the CML compiler's base libraries.
Third-party libraries can also provide their own templates,
along with their conceptual models,
in order to target specific technologies or platforms.
Developers can also extend existing templates in order to adapt the implementation to characteristics specific to their projects.

Subsection \ref{subsec:overview} provides an overview of the CML compiler's architecture.
Next, subsection \ref{subsec:templates} introduces the CML compiler's extensible templates.
Finally, subsection \ref{subsec:modlib} lays out the CML compiler's mechanism for organizing and sharing conceptual models and extensible templates.

\section{The Extensible Compiler}\label{sec:compiler}

In order to realize the CMP \cite{cmp} manifesto's vision,
the CML compiler can generate code in any target language
if the corresponding templates are provided.
A set of core templates is provided by CML compiler's base module,
which is currently supporting Java and Python.
In order to target specific technologies or platforms,
third-party modules can also provide their own templates,
along with their conceptual models.
Developers can also extend existing templates
in order to adapt the implementation to characteristics specific to their projects.

Subsection \ref{subsec:overview} provides an overview of the CML compiler's architecture.
Next, subsection \ref{subsec:templates} introduces the CML compiler's extensible templates.
Finally, subsection \ref{subsec:modlib} lays out the CML compiler's mechanism for organizing and sharing conceptual models and extensible templates.
